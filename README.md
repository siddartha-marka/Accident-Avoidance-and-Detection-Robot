# Accident-Avoidance-and-Detection-Robot
The project proposes robotic vehicle that has an intelligence built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path.  If the robot met with any accident a SMS will be sent to a registered mobile number, and this message contains the GPS coordinates of the accident location.
